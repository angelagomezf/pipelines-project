# Instagram vs. Spotify - To Be or Not To Be
# An analysis project where a database has been enriched using the Spotify API
The **main objective** of this project is to make use of APIs to enrich a database of our choice and proceed to is analysis afterwards.


## 1. Choosing a Database
- Everyone knows what Instagram is, but not everyone knows who the top most followed persons on the platform are.

- Sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/tanujdhiman/top-most-followed-on-instagram

- Disclaimer: The data is not up-to-date.

## 2. Data Cleaning
- Even though it wasn't the main goal of this project, I proceeded to clean a little bit the dataset.

## 3. Choosing an API
- The first choice was *Instagram Basic Display API*. However, after encountering quite a few issues, I decided to change it and go after **Spotify's API**.

## 4. Drawing Conclusions
- After cleaning and enriching the database, I then proceeded to plot some results and draw conclusions.
